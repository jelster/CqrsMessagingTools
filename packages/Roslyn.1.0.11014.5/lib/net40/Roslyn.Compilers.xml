            Debugger.NotifyOfCrossThreadDependency, which causes the debugger to prompt
            the user for confirmation (little swirling red and blue icon) before evaluating
            an expression that will involve multiple threads.  To prevent this from happening
            we make the call ourselved *before* acquiring the lock.  Then, when the user
            opts to proceed, the evaluation runs without interruption and succeeds.

             Emits types in a given <see cref="T:Microsoft.Cci.IModule"/> to a <see cref="T:System.Reflection.Emit.ModuleBuilder"/>.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             Some types can't be emitted either due to the current Reflection.Emit implementation bugs/architecture or 
             due to limitations of collectible assemblies (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd554932.aspx).
             
             The main problem with Reflection.Emit is that it uses two-phase type creation process. <see cref="T:System.Reflection.Emit.TypeBuilder"/>s are defined in the first phase
             and created (baked) one by one in the second. This isn't compatible with the way how CLR Type Loader loads cyclic type references. 
             
             The following rules apply and imply a partial order on the type baking (based upon observation and tests; they are not clearly documented anywhere) :
             1) Before a type can be baked its derived type and all interfaces it implements needs to be baked.
             2) Before a generic type can be baked the constraints of its generic type parameters need to be baked.
             3) Before a type can be baked all types of its fields that are value types need to be baked (reference typed fields don't).
             4) If a type is dependent on a generic type instantiation it is also dependent on its generic arguments.
             5) If a type is dependent on a type nested in another type the outer type need to be baked first.
            
             If these rule imply an order that is not satisfiable (there is a cycle) the emitter throws <see cref="T:System.NotSupportedException"/>.
             
             TODO (tomat):
             Some of these rules can be circumvented by using AppDomain.TypeLoad event, but it's unclear which exactly (I suspect #4).
             
             Examples of type topologies that can't be emitted today are:
             
             <code>
             class B{T} where T : A              // B depends on A by rule #2
             class A : B{A}                      // A depends on B by rule #1
             </code>
             
             <code>
             public class E                      
             {
                 public struct N2
                 {
                     public N3 n1;               // E.N2 depends on E.N3 by rule #3 and thus on E by rule #5
                 }
                 public struct N3    
                 {
                 }
                 N2 n2;                          // E depends on E.N2 by rule #3

            The CachingLookup class provides a convenient representation of an ILookup that is based
            upon a potentially slow lookup, and caches lookup results so that subsequent lookups are
            fast. Internally a ConcurrentDictionary is used to cache lookup results. The client provides
            two delegates to perform lookups: One that maps a key to a IEnumerable of values, and one
            that provides all keys.
            
            The client must provide an IEqualityComparer used for comparing keys, and can select whether
            to cache failed lookups (keys with no values). Caching failed lookups has the disadvantage
            that every different failed lookup will consume a small amount of extra memory.

            The compilation object is an immutable representation of a single invocation of the

            <remarks>
            <para>An instance of ISemanticModel caches local symbols and semantic information. Thus, it
            is much more efficient to use a single instance of ISemanticModel when asking multiple
            questions about a syntax tree, because information from the first question may be reused.
            This also means that holding onto an instance of ISemanticModel for a long time may keep a
            significant amount of memory from being garbage collected.

            When an answer is a named symbol that is reachable by traversing from the root of the symbol
            table, (that is, from an AssemblySymbol of the Compilation), that symbol will be returned
            (i.e. the returned value will be reference-equal to one reachable from the root of the
            symbol table). Symbols representing entities without names (e.g. array-of-int) may or may
            not exhibit reference equality. However, some named symbols (such as local variables) are
            not reachable from the root. These symbols are visible as answers to semantic questions.
            When the same SemanticModel object is used, the answers exhibit reference-equality.

            Generic implementation of object pooling pattern with predefined size limit. The main
            purpose is that limited quantity of frequently used objects can be kept in the pool for
            further recycling.
            
            Notes: 
            1) it is not the goal to keep all returned objects. Pool is not meant for storage. If there
               is no space in the pool, extra returned objects will be dropped.
            
            2) it is implied that if object was obtained from a pool, the caller will return it back in
               relatively short time. 
            
            Not returning objects to the pool in not critical to the pool's work, but is a bad practice. 
            Rationale: 
            If there is no intent for reusing the object, do not get pool involved - just use "new".    ///

            <remarks>
            The full names of uncollectible assemblies generated by this context must be unique,

            identity into the same load context.
            
            We are using a certain naming scheme for the generated assemblies (a fixed name prefix followed by a number). 
            If we allowed the compiled code to add references that match this exact pattern it migth happen that 
            the user supplied reference identity conflicts with the identity we use for our generated assemblies and 
            the AppDomain assembly resolve event won't be able to correctly identify the target assembly.
            
            To avoid this problem we use a prefix for assemblies we generate that is unlikely to conflict with user specified references.
            We also check that no user provided references are allowed to be used in the compiled code and report an error ("reserved assembly name").

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Although in theory any expression is allowed to be embedded in the string such behavior is in practice fundamentally broken.
            The attribute doesn't specify what language (VB, C#, F#, etc.) to use to parse these expressions. Even if it did all languages 
            would need to be able to evaluate each other language's expressions, which is not viable and the Expression Evaluator doesn't 
            work that way today. Instead it evaluates the embedded expressions in the language of the current method frame. When consuming 
            VB objects from C#, for example, the evaluation migth fail due to language mismatch (evaluating VB expression using C# parser).
            
            Therefore we limit the expressions to a simple language independent syntax: {clr-member-name} '(' ')' ',nq', 
            where parentheses and ,nq suffix (no-quotes) are optional and the name is an arbitrary CLR field, property, or method name.
            We then resolve the member by name using case-sensitive lookup first with fallback to case insensitive and evaluate it.
            If parentheses are present we only look for methods.
            Only parameter less members are considered.

            <summary>
            Represents a thread-safe, mutable bag of diagnostics. You can add diagnostics to the bag,
            and also get all the diagnostics out of the bag (the bag implements
            IEnumerable&lt;Diagnostics&gt;. Once added, diagnostics cannot be removed, and no ordering
            is guaranteed.
            
            The bag can also be sealed, after which attempts to add additional errors will throw an
            exception. This is a useful to present errors from being incorrectly added to a bag too
            late.

            If this syntax tree is not associated with a file, this FileName can (and often will) be the empty string.

            The FileName is used in two important ways:
               When debug information is emitted, this name is embedded in the debug information.
               When the GetLineSpan function on the SyntaxTree is called, it is used as the file name

            of the mapping entries is done and nearest line mapping is applied.
